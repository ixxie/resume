<h1>startup seeking contractor?</h1>

<p>
	I'm a great
	<a href="https://wildcardpeople.com/what-is-a-wildcard-person">wildcard</a> for a startup! I've worked
	as a senior fullstack software engineer, a data scientist and a product owner; I've even done some
	UI/UX design and marketing work. I'm available for contract work to support startup teams.
</p>

<h2>my approach</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Crowdsource the Vision</b> - tap into the knowledge and experience of your team, your target audience
		and other stakeholders during research, design and strategizing processes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Iterate towards Agility</b> - understand the realities faced by the team, make small incremental
		improvements and draw on a variety of methodologies to improve team processes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Keep things Neat</b> - maintain and expand a design, codebase, architecture and documentation
		that is easy for others to understand and extend.
	</li>
</ol>
